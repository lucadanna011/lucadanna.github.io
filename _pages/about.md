I am a PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University, Milan. I graduated in Mathematics from the University of Pavia, where I mainly explored the fields of Probability and Statistics Theory, Mathematical Analysis and Optimization. My current reasearch interests are on Stochastic Processes, Stochastic Differential Equations, Stochastic Control and Mathematical Finance.
